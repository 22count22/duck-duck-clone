# Development Strategy

> `duck-duck-clone`

write a short description of your project:
- who would want to use it?
- why would they want to use it?

Our task is to clone the [home page of Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com/?va=z&t=hr&atb=v214-1). Every member of the team will do a part of the assignment.
We will work on the same HTML and CSS files, and each student will make a section.
The final web page should look like this.
