# Development Strategy

> `duck-duck-clone`

write a short description of your project:
- who would want to use it?
- why would they want to use it?

Our task is to clone the [home page of Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com/?va=z&t=hr&atb=v214-1). Every member of the team will do a part of the assignment.
We will work on the same HTML and CSS files, and each student will make a section.
We decided to use Bootstrap. We try to avoid conflicts by using prefixes in our divs like in `monster-main` and by using ids instead of classes. While the common divs will use the conventional classes used in Bootstrap.

Example:

```html
<!-- section monster -->
<div class="container>
  <div class="row">
    <div id="monster-main>
    </div>
  </div>              
</div>
```

<div align = "center">
  
Home section | Monster section | Ghost section | Bathtub section | Alpinist section
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
Burak  | Divya | Kemi | Patrick | Bermarte

</div>
